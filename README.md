# Sentiment Analysis of Marketing

This repository contains code for sentiment analysis of marketing text data. The purpose of this project is to analyze the sentiment (positive, negative, or neutral) of marketing content to gain insights into customer opinions and feedback.

## Dependencies

Before running the code, make sure you have the following dependencies installed:

- Python (version 3.6 or higher)
- Jupyter Notebook (optional but recommended for interactive analysis)
- Libraries: 
    - Pandas
    - NumPy
    - Matplotlib (for data visualization)
    - Natural Language Toolkit (NLTK) for text preprocessing
    - Scikit-learn for machine learning
    - TextBlob for sentiment analysis
    - WordCloud for visualizing word frequency (optional)

You can install the required libraries using `pip`:

```bash
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib nltk scikit-learn textblob wordcloud
```

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:  
bash git clone https://github.com/sathishkumar1111/Sentiment-analysis-for-marketing.git
```

2. Create a virtual environment (recommended):

```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
```

3. Install the required dependencies as mentioned in the "Dependencies" section.

4. Data Preparation:

   - Place your marketing text data in a CSV file (e.g., `marketing_data.csv`) with two columns: `text` and `label` (1 for positive, 0 for neutral, -1 for negative).

5. Run the Jupyter Notebook (or the Python script) to perform sentiment analysis:

```bash
jupyter notebook SentimentAnalysis.ipynb
```

6. In the Jupyter Notebook, replace the data file path with your own data file:

```python
# Load the marketing data
data = pd.read_csv('marketing_data.csv')
```

7. Follow the instructions in the Jupyter Notebook to preprocess the text data, train a sentiment analysis model, and evaluate the results.

## Results

After running the code, you will obtain sentiment analysis results along with visualizations (if you choose to use WordCloud). You can use these results to gain insights into the sentiment of your marketing content.
